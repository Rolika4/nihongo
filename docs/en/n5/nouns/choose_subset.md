- **どの** is used when the speaker has several options to choose from and wants to know which one the listener is interested in.

## Note

- **どの** is also used in contexts of choosing objects within a specific category, for example, "which movie?", "which book?", and so on.
- The use of **どの** implies that the listener has several options to choose from, and the question is directed at selecting a specific object.
