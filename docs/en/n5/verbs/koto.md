# Nominalization with ことが and ことを

**Nominalization with ことが** and **ことを** is used to turn a verb into a noun, which can function as a subject, object, or complement in a sentence. These constructions allow us to talk about an action or event as something abstract or a process, but with different emphases.

### General Description

- **こと** turns an action into a noun, and **が** or **を** are added depending on the function the noun performs.

### Formation

- Verb in the dictionary form + **ことが** — to express the action or event as the subject.
- Verb in the dictionary form + **ことを** — to express the action as the object.

#### ことが

**ことが** is used to emphasize the action as a process or event. It is often used in sentences where the action is the subject.

**Examples:**

1. **食べることが好きです**
   **たべることがすきです**
   "I like eating (the process of eating)."
   Here, the verb **食べる** (to eat) is turned into the noun **食べること** (the process of eating), and **ことが** indicates that the subject is "the process of eating."

2. **日本語を勉強することが大切です**
   **にほんごをべんきょうすることがたいせつです**
   "Studying Japanese is important."
   Here, the action "studying Japanese" is expressed as a noun with **勉強すること**.

3. **彼が来ることが楽しみです**
   **かれがくることがたのしみです**
   "I am looking forward to his arrival."
   **来ること** (arrival) is treated as a noun.

#### ことを

**ことを** is used when the emphasis is on the action itself as an object, rather than on the process. This construction is used to express that the action is the object being performed or focused on.

**Examples:**

1. **食べることを忘れた**
   **たべることをわすれた**
   "I forgot to eat."
   Here, **食べること** (eating) is the action that became the object of forgetting, and **ことを** indicates the object of the action.

2. **日本語を勉強することを始めました**
   **にほんごをべんきょうすることをはじめました**
   "I started learning Japanese."
   Here, **勉強すること** (learning) is the action that became the object of beginning.

3. **映画を見ることを楽しみにしています**
   **えいがをみることをたのしみにしています**
   "I’m looking forward to watching the movie."
   **見ること** (watching) is the action that is the object of expectation.

### Important Points
- **ことが** is used for the **subject**, emphasizing the process or event itself.
- **ことを** is used for the **object**, emphasizing the action as something that is performed or achieved.

### Note
- Unlike **ことが**, where the action is considered a process, **ことを** emphasizes that the action is something that is done or achieved.
